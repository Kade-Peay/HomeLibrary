## Description

A library system for my books at home. I want to be able to have a list of books, be able to mark which ones I have in my home library, mark if they are lent out to friends, and etc. 

## Technologies

I'd like to make this a desktop application so I will look into using something like Django or Electron.

I have decided to start by writing the functionality of everything and I wanted to use TypeScript so I am doing that now.
